Purpose of this project is to define the stock price in the coming future.
Following are the packages that are used in this program: 
yfinance: A Python library to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance. It provides an easy-to-use interface to fetch historical stock data, including open, high, low, close, and volume.

1. numpy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

2. sklearn.model_selection: Part of scikit-learn, this module provides functions for splitting data into training and test sets, cross-validation, and other utilities to assist in model selection and evaluation.

3. sklearn.ensemble: A module within scikit-learn that implements ensemble learning methods, such as Random Forest. Ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to improve the overall performance.

4. sklearn.metrics: A submodule in scikit-learn offering various metrics for evaluating the performance of machine learning models. It includes functions for computing classification, regression, and clustering metrics like mean squared error (MSE).

5. datetime: A module in Python's standard library for working with dates and times. It provides classes for manipulating dates and times, formatting and parsing dates, and calculating time differences.
